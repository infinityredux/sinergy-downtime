Downtime development
====================

This is a plunk designed to be used for the sole purpose of allowing me to 
develop the web app to assist people with downtime, without having to use a 
development environment.

For those more curious, it is based around ruleset for the LARP game SINergy
(www.sinergylarp.com) and if you don't know what that means... Image you live in
the dark future promised by cyberpunk, with super powerful corporations, cyborgs
running amok, bioengeered creatures roaming the streets, virtual reality through 
the matrix and guns, lots of guns.  That place you went to in your head? That's 
SINergy, so come join us - the water is fine... (though perhaps slightly 
radioactive, maybe.)
