SINergy downtime helper
=======================
For full details of this project, see the link above, but this started out as a plunk 
(http://plnkr.co) for me to work on developing a downtime helper for LARP game SINergy
(http://www.sinergylarp.com).

If you don't know what that means... Image you live in
the dark future promised by cyberpunk, with super powerful corporations, cyborgs
running amok, bioengeered creatures roaming the streets, virtual reality through 
the matrix and guns, lots of guns.  That place you went to in your head? That's 
SINergy, so if that sounds interesting (and you're in the UK) come join us - the water 
is fine... (though perhaps slightly radioactive, maybe.)
